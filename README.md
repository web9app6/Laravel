## Introduction

Laravel Forge is a server management and site deployment service. After connecting to your preferred server provider, Forge will provision a new server, installing and configuring: PHP, Nginx, MySQL, and more.

In addition, Forge can assist you in managing scheduled jobs, queue workers, SSL certificates, and more. After a server has provisioned, you can then deploy your PHP / Laravel applications or WordPress applications using the Forge UI dashboard or the Forge CLI.

This repository contains the CLI client for interacting with Laravel Forge. To learn more about Forge and how to use this client, please consult the **[official documentation](https://forge.laravel.com/docs)**.
